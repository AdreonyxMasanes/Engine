This is my attempt to make a relatively basic graphics engine. The things I want this engine to do our as follows:
I want it to display objects or models to the screen. 
I want the objects or models to have textures.
I want the scene to have basic lighting applied.
I want the objects to have basic physics.
I want a basic UI to manipulate the scene.
